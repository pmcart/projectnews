Got it — you’re basically trying to build a “breaking-news aggregator” that not only captures the fact of the news but also pulls in raw media, commentary, and reporting from different channels.
Here are categories + concrete sources/feeds you can look at:

🔹 Social media & short-form content

These tend to surface raw “on-the-ground” content before mainstream outlets:

Twitter / X (already doing) → text + photos/videos from accounts or hashtags.

TikTok (already doing) → short video reactions and first-person footage.

Instagram → hashtags, location tags (often reposts of live events).

Facebook → public posts, group feeds (good for local communities).

YouTube → livestreams and breaking uploads; check “News” category, trending, or via YouTube API.

Reddit → subreddits like r/news, r/worldnews, r/UkrainianConflict, r/liveupdates, etc.

🔹 Traditional news + wires

Reuters, AP, AFP → wire services are usually first among major outlets.

Google News / Bing News APIs → cluster and deduplicate mainstream reporting.

RSS feeds of specific outlets (NYT, BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, regional newspapers).

Press releases → PR Newswire, GlobeNewswire (sometimes the earliest official word).

🔹 Blogs & community reporting

Medium / Substack → commentary & analysis (not always instant).

Niche blogs → defense blogs, local journalists, open-source investigation groups.

WordPress / Blogspot → long tail; you can monitor via blog search engines.

🔹 Official + government

Government / municipal sites (press rooms, advisories, emergency services).

Police / fire department Twitter accounts or feeds.

NGOs / UN / WHO → for disaster, health, humanitarian news.

🔹 Specialized media sources

Live TV / streaming → CNN live, Sky News, Al Jazeera live streams.

Radio + podcasts → some stations break stories quickly (NPR, BBC radio).

Photo wire agencies → Getty Images breaking photo feeds, AP Images.

🔹 Niche / OSINT-friendly sources

FlightRadar24 / MarineTraffic → track incidents with planes/ships.

Earthquake, weather, disaster feeds (USGS, EMSC, NOAA, GDACS).

Security cameras / traffic cams (where legal and public).

🔹 Aggregators / firehoses

CrowdTangle (Meta tool for Facebook/Instagram, limited access).

News API (paid service).

GDELT Project → global event database with near-real-time updates.

Meltwater / Dataminr / Factal (enterprise services for journalists).

Use social for raw media (fastest, but noisy + lots o
